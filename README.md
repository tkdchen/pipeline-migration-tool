# Pipeline Migration Tool

Pipeline migration tool is command line tool applying migrations for Konflux pipelines. It also
allows to modify Konflux build pipelines locally.

## Commands

### To apply migrations with `migrate`

Applying migrations is the major feature of pipeline-migration-tool. It auto-discovers migrations
for given task bundle upgrades and applies found migrations to build pipelines. The pipeline can be
either included in a `PipelineRun` definition as `spec.pipelineSpec` or a single `Pipeline`
defintion.

To make it work, migrations must be attached to corresponding task bundles as OCI artifacts,
typically with `oras attach`. Let's go deep dive a bit.

* If a task bundle has a migration, it must be annotated with `dev.konflux-ci.task.has-migration: true`
* A migration must be attached to the bundle with artifact type `text/x-shellscript` and annotated
  with `dev.konflux-ci.task.is-migration: true`.
* A task bundle has only one migration.
* A migration is written as a normal Bash script. Generally, it invokes `yq` to modify the pipelines.

Document [Task Migration]
(https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/?tab=readme-ov-file#task-migration) of
konflux-ci/build-definitions describes the migrations in detail. build-definitions provides a rich
tool chain and CI for creation, validation and ensuring migrations are available to
pipeline-migration-tool.

pipeline-migration-tool is configured in Konflux Mintmaker as a Renovate post-upgrade command and
Renovate is responsible for invoke migration tool properly. Then, in general, it is unnecessary for
Konflux users to run `migrate` by themselves.

To apply migrations, run command:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
pmt migrate -u '<upgrades>'
```

`upgrades` is a JSON string encoded from a list of mappings. Each mapping includes data for a
single task bundle upgrade, for example:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "depName": "quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/task-init",
    "currentValue": "0.1",
    "currentDigest": "sha256:...",
    "newValue": "0.1",
    "newDigest": "sha256:...",
    "packageFile": ".tekton/component-name-pull.yaml",
    "parentDir": ".tekton",
    "depTypes": ["tekton-bundle"]
  },
  // ...
]
```

The field names map to the [Renovate template fields]
(https://docs.renovatebot.com/templates/#other-available-fields) directly:

* `depName`: `{{depName}}`
* `currentValue`: `{{currentValue}}`
* `currentDigest`: `{{currentDigest}}`
* `newValue`: `{{newValue}}`
* `newDigest`: `{{newDigest}}`
* `packageFile`: `{{packageFile}}`
* `parentDir`: `{{parentDir}}`
* `depTypes`: `{{depTypes}}`

To generate the list, handlebars built-in `each` helper of Renovate is used.

### Add a Konflux task to build pipeline with `add-task`

Sub-command `add-task` provides rich options to add a Konflux task to build pipelines in local
Component repositories. Let's take the task `sast-coverity-check` as an example to see a few
command usages:

* Add task with latest bundle to pipelines from inside a repository:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task sast-coverity-check
  ```

  where `./.tekton/` is the default location to search pipelines.

* Add task to multiple locations:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task sast-coverity-check \
    /path/to/repo1/pipeline.yaml /path/to/repo2/pipeline-run.yaml ...
  ```

* Specify alternative task bundle explicitly:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task --bundle-ref quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/task-sast-coverity-check:0.1@sha256:... \
    sast-coverity-check \
    /path/to/repo1/pipeline.yaml /path/to/repo2/pipeline-run.yaml ...
  ```

Get more information by `pmt add-task -h`

## Run tests

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
tox
```

## Integration test

pipeline-migration-tool relies on task bundles are annotated and migrations are attached properly.
This integration test sets up a testing environment, inside which tasks are built and pushed by the
`build-and-push.sh` script.

Prerequisite:

- A local clone of [konflux-ci/build-definitions](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions) 
  and checkout to `main` branch.
- Create public image repositories `task-clone` and `task-lint` under specified `QUAY_NAMESPACE`.
- Log into Quay.io in order to make `tkn-bundle-push` work.

For different test scenarios, the task bundles can be customized by setting `RECIPE` environment
variable for `hack/integration-test/setup.sh`. A recipe is a multi-lines text and each line consists
of three fields in order, task name, task version, and marker indicating whether the task bundle
build should have a migration. For example:

```bash
RECIPE="
clone 0.3 M
lint 0.3 -
"
```

Example steps to run the test:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .

git checkout -b <test branch>  # setup.sh commits changes to the repo

# Empty the image repositories of task-clone and task-lint

BUILD_DEFS_REPO="<absolute path to build-definitions>" \
QUAY_NAMESPACE="<quay namespace passed to build-definitions/hack/build-and-push.sh>" \
./hack/integration-test/setup.sh

cd ./hack/integration-test/app
PMT_LOCAL_TEST=1 pmt migrate -u "$(cat /tmp/pmt-test-upgrades.txt)"

# Check if the tool works as expected.
```

## Make a release

### Versioning

Releases are versioned in the form of `major.minor.patch`.

- Major version remains 0.
- Minor version is incremented when new feature and backward incompatible changes are introduced.
- Patch version is incremented when backward compatible changes are introduced.

For example:

- Code refactor: `++patch`
- Non-code change: `++patch`
- Add a new command line argument: `++minor`
- A bug fix that does not introduce changes to the original behavior and command line interface:
  `++patch`, otherwise `++minor`

### Steps

Follow these steps to make and publish a release. Here, version `0.4.2` is used as an example.

- Synchronize with `main` branch
- Checkout to a release branch `release-0.4.2`
- Update version in `src/pipeline_migration/__init__.py`
- Commit the change with title `Release 0.4.2` and open a pull request.
- Review and merge the pull request
- Go to https://github.com/konflux-ci/pipeline-migration-tool/releases/new
- Create a new tag `v0.4.2`
- Ensure the target is `main` branch
- Click button `Generate release notes` and refine the release notes if necessary
- Check `Set as the latest release`
- Click button `Publish release`

Done ðŸŽ‰

Then, Renovate will send an update pull request to [konflux-ci/mintmaker-renovate-image]
(https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker-renovate-image) automatically in order to upgrade
pipeline-migration-tool to the new version.

Post-release steps:

- It is highly recommend to link the Renovate update pull request to the release story.
- If there is no release story for the new release, it can be optionally linked to the major feature
  or bugfix JIRA issue.
- Open a pull request to MintMaker [Renovate configuration]
  (https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker/blob/main/config/renovate/renovate.json) when necessary
  to use new command line interface.

### Run script alternatively

Executes commands in the following order to help making a release:

```bash
./hack/make-release make_release_for_review version issue-key
# Once pull request gets approved, it can be either merged via GitHub web UI or the following step
./hack/make-release merge_and_publish_release version
```

> [!NOTE]
> If customization is required based on the auto-generated notes, please do manual release creation
  via repository Releases page.
